# Passbook

Just a simple password storage app I made because I wasn't satisfied with other password managers and didn't really trust them. Passbook was an avenue for me to learn a few things and now, looking back, the code is bad enough that I don't really want to take the time to fix it. Nonetheless, I haven't had any crashes (maybe a bug or two, though) and SOMEHOW I've had over 32,000 downloads on it... but arounf 1,100 current users. Why? I think it's because it's called Passbook and people thought it was something else. Turns out Apple has an app called Passbook, too, which does something entirely different... and I had no idea at the time.

Go easy on me, I wrote this a while ago!
