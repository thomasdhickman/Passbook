    <string name="about">Thanks for installing Passbook.\n\n
        This is a super simple data storage app to keep your passwords and private information safe from other people and easy for you to access.\n\n
        Please note that forgotton PINs can\'t be recovered, but you can change your PIN once you\'ve set it.\n\n
        After five failed login attempts, all of your data will be deleted and you\'ll have to reinstall the app to use it.\n\n
        When adding an entry, you\'ll notice the fields are labeled Key, Value, and Value (Optional). Use the Key field to specify what exactly you\'re trying to save. If it\'s your Facebook password, type Facebook. The two value fields can be used for username and password, respectively.\n\n
        The second value field is optional if you just want to store two lines of information. This is helpful if you also want to store something other than login credentials.\n\n
        To add an entry, hit the plus sign on the action bar.\n\n
        Tap an entry you\'d like to edit to modify its data.\n\n
        To delete an entry, press and hold.\n\n</string>
